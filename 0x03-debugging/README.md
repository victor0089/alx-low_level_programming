`IDENTIFY ERROR`![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105258746/190832836-b113fa0f-e26f-4db1-b8c5-d094c3dfd0a7.png) `ANALYZE ERROR`


Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.
`YOU HAVE TO CRAETE YOUR PROTOTYPE ON YOUR main.h file FOR YOUR CODES TO WORK`

## File: 0-main.c
In most projects, we often give you only one main file to test with. For example, this main file is a test for a postitive_or_negative() function similar to the one you worked with in an earlier C project:
```
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 98;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
```
Based on the `main.c` file above, create a file named `0-main.c.` This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, youâ€™re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, [if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.](https://github.com/Lordwill1/alx-low_level_programming/blob/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while/0-positive_or_negative.c)

## File: 1-main.c
Copy this main file. Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
- Donâ€™t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
- You do not have to compile with `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic` for this task.
- 
```
#include <stdio.h>

/**
* main - causes an infinite loop
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        printf("Infinite loop incoming :(\n");

        i = 0;

        while (i < 10)
        {
                putchar(i);
        }

        printf("Infinite loop avoided! \\o/\n");

        return (0);
}
```
## File: 2-largest_number.c, main.h
This program prints the largest of three integers.
```
#include "main.h"

/**
 * largest_number - returns the largest of 3 numbers
 * @a: first integer
 * @b: second integer
 * @c: third integer
 * Return: largest number
 */

int largest_number(int a, int b, int c)
{
    int largest;

    if (a > b && b > c)
    {
        largest = a;
    }
    else if (b > a && a > c)
    {
        largest = b;
    }
    else
    {
        largest = c;
    }

    return (largest);
}
```
Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.

## File: 3-print_remaining_days.c, main.h
This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration.
### NOTE: FOR YOU TO UNDERSTAND THE CODE ON SAMPLE 2, YOU NEED KNOWLEDGE OF LOGIC TRUTH TABLE.

* Code sample 1
```
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - takes a date and prints how many days are left in the year, taking
* leap years into account
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
    int month;
    int day;
    int year;

    month = 4;
    day = 01;
    year = 1997;

    printf("Date: %02d/%02d/%04d\n", month, day, year);

    day = convert_day(month, day);

    print_remaining_days(month, day, year);

    return (0);
}
```

* Code sample 2 (You need knowledge on logic truth table)

#include <stdio.h>
#include "main.h"

/**

    month = 4;
    day = 01;
    year = 1997;

    printf("Date: %02d/%02d/%04d\n", month, day, year);

    day = convert_day(month, day);

    print_remaining_days(month, day, year);

    return (0);
}

`Output below ^1 looks good for 04/01/1997! We make a new main file 3-main_b.c to try a case that is a leap year: 02/29/2000.`

### Fix the `print_remaining_days()` function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.

* Line count will not be checked for this task.
- You can assume that all test cases have valid months (i.e. the value of month will never be less than 1 or greater than 12) and valid days (i.e. the value of day will never be less than 1 or greater than 31).
- You can assume that all test cases have valid month/day combinations (i.e. there will never be a June 31st or November 31st, etc.), but not all month/day/year combinations are valid (i.e. February 29, 1991 or February 29, 2427).


# AS A PROGRAMMER, WHAT DO YOU DO WHEN YOU GET STUCK?
- To help you track down that bug, start reading your code aloud. 
- Pretend that a programmer friend is sitting right next to you. 
- Explain what your code is doing and how it works. As you talk through your code, youâ€™ll find the problem. If you donâ€™t, have your imaginary friend ask you questions during your explanation.
- Donâ€™t worry about going mental. Youâ€™re a C programmer. Youâ€™re already mental. ðŸ˜…


As a bonus, talking through your code also helps you identify which portions need to have comments and what the comments should be.
